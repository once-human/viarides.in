# Via Rides - Landing Page

This repository contains the code for the landing page of [Via Rides](https://viarides.in), a subscription-based ride booking service planned for launch in India.

This website serves as a "Coming Soon" page, built with:

*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** (Styling)
*   **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** (Animations)

## Current Status

The page displays a simple announcement with visual effects (background blobs, mouse follower). It is currently set to a dark theme only.
